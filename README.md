Files and codes under this repository is only for acadamic use, thank you.


%% stack files of 100 Mb were separated into 5 stacks 20 Mb to avoid 25 Mb upload limitation of GitHub
0. Download all files in https://github.com/superres/iSCAT.
1. RUN arrange_files.m to prepare experimental image stacks.
2. Run file simulated_single_particle_noise_fft_show_fig2.m, to demonstrate Figure 3 and Figure 4 of the manuscript.
3. Run file generate_ground_truth_and_simulated_raw_image_fig3_4.m, to demonstrate Figure 3 and Figure 4 of the manuscript.
